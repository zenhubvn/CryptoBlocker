#
# Add one filescreen per line that you want to ignore
#
# For example, if *.doc files are being blocked by the list but you want 
# to allow them, simply add a new line in this file that exactly matches 
# the filescreen:
#
# *.doc
#
# The script will check this file every time it runs and remove these 
# entries before applying the list to your FSRM implementation.
